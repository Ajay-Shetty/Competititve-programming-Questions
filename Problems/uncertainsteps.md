Calculate Total no ways to go down the stairs 

if a person can go three ways 
1. walk one step at a time
2. walk two step at a time
3. jump 3 steps  at a time

Given n steps, calculate total no of possible ways to reach the ground, provided he can jump three steps at most once 
during this process . That is he can jump down 3 stairs only once but at any time if he wishes.

1<= N<= 1000000


INPUT

single integer n

OUTPUT

Number of ways to reach the ground 
AS the nnumber can be  huge give output modulo  1000000007
